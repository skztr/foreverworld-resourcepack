### Foreverworld Resourcepack
This is a resourcepack for use with the ["Forever World" Datapack](https://github.com/skztr/foreverworld).

It replaces the "normal" heart icons with "hardcore" heart icons, to
indicate that the player has (in practical terms) only one life.

It removes the "map edge" marker icons, which otherwise allow a player
to use maps to find their way home regardless of distance.
